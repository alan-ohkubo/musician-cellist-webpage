# musician-cellist-webpage

This project was created to fulfill the requirements for the Code Louisville Front End
Web Development January 2021 session. It is a musician/artist website for myself and is meant to be a platform for prospective students and other guests to learn about my work and get in touch.


The following features were implemented to fulfill project requirements:

CSS:

●	A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon

> The Navigation bar is horizontal at large screen sizes and collapses to a hamburger sidebar menu on small screens. The sidebar CSS is found on lines 84-148.

● Create your own original CSS animation. For example, create a loading spinner or menu
animation.

> 1.) Created an concentric geometric shapes animation that displays on the welcome screen. A starting point for designing a dynamic site logo and working toward a dynamic website that breathes in a tastful way. CSS appears on lines 167-201.

> 2.) The sidebar menu utilizes the CSS transition to appear to slide out on opening and retract on close.

> 3.) The menu buttons change appearance slightly on hover using the :hover pseudoclass.


JavaScript:

●	Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction - must be done with some JavaScript code.

> The HTML is structured as a single page, but divs are selective hidden and shown by selecting options from the navigation menu. Clicking on a navigation item runs a JavaScript function which shows the desired div, while hiding others. These functions can be found on lines 5-35 of script.js.
