# musician-cellist-webpage

This project was created to fulfill the requirements for the Code Louisville Front End
Web Development January 2021 session. It is a musician/artist website for myself and provides a way for prospective students and other guests to learn about my work and get in touch.

The following features were implemented to fulfill project requirements:

CSS:

●	A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon

> The Navigation bar is horizontal on large screens and collapses to a hamburger sidebar menu on small screens.

JavaScript:

●	Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction - must be done with some JavaScript code.

> The Navigation buttons runs a couple JavaScript functions which hide and show the desired div.

●	Create a custom video player with at least one custom element (such as the progress bar, play button, etc). This is also not covered in the required Treehouse content.

>Work in progress

●	Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least one field (ex: email is in the correct format) and then use that information on your page somehow. For example, display it back to the user on button click, or change a setting on the page based on a section. Having a form that does nothing on clicking Submit or that just refreshes the page is not enough - you must capture the value(s) of the form and use it somehow.
