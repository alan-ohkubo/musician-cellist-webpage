            <p class="flex-item">
                Cellist, Alan Ohkubo recently completed a fellowship at the New World Symphony in Miami Beach, Florida. He was a member of the
                New Haven Symphony Orchestra and served as Principal Cello of the Eastern Connecticut
                Symphony Orchestra, where he appeared as soloist in Dvořák's cello concerto. The New
                London Day praised Mr. Ohkubo for "technique with a swaggering panache, retaining
                musicality...robust fullness from lower register...to the top."
