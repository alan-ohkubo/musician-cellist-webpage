        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>Cellist, Alan Ohkubo...completed a fellowship at the New World Symphony in Miami Beach, Florida. He was a member of the
            New Haven Symphony Orchestra and served as Principal Cello of the Eastern Connecticut
            Symphony Orchestra, where he appeared as soloist in Dvořák's cello concerto. The New
            London Day praised Mr. Ohkubo for "technique with a swaggering panache, retaining
            musicality...robust fullness from lower register...to the top."
        </p>
        <p>
            Alan completed an Artist Diploma and a Master of Music degree at the Yale University
            School of Music under the tutelage of master cellist and pedagogue Aldo Parisot. Prior to Yale,
            Alan studied with world-renowned cellist and teacher Janos Starker at Indiana University
            as a Barbara and David Jacobs Scholar.
        </p>
        <p>
            An avid chamber musician, Alan has performed alongside artists such as David Shifrin, Lawrence Dutton,
            Cho-Liang Lin, Daniel Ching, and Ko Iwasaki, among others. He has also appeared in solo and chamber recitals in Tokyo
            and New York City on Charlotte White's Salon de Virtuosi concert series. Alan took part
            in a series of concerts in Carnegie Hall while participating in the New York String Orchestra
            Seminar. In recent summers, he has attended Music Masters Course Japan, an intensive
            chamber music seminar held in Yokohama.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alan is also a passionate teacher. He teaches privately and is a faculty member at Porterville Strings, a summer String
